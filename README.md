# cloud-career-playbook
There's so much opportunity when it comes to working in cloud but it can be confusing to get started because there is so much to learn. My goal with this project is to give you a map that will keep you on course as you build up your career in the cloud.

In this playbook I'll be sharing text, video, and audio resources for each of the core "career domains" that you'll need to study which include:

* Cloud Platform Foundations
* Command Line Essentials
* Sysadmin Fundamentals
* Distributed Version Control
* Infrastructure as Code
* CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
* Programming & Software Development
* Containers & Orchestration
* Monitoring & Observability
* Serverless Computing
* Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
* Culture and Core Values
* Resume & LinkedIn Optimization
* Interview Prep & Salary Negotiation

I'll be actively updating this project on a daily basis until complete. ETA is December 2021.
