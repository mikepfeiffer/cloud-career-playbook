# cloud-career-playbook
There's so much opportunity when it comes to working in cloud but it can be confusing to get started because there is so much to learn. My goal with this project is to give you a map that will keep you on course as you build up your career in the cloud.

In this playbook I'll be sharing text, video, and audio resources for each of the core "career domains" listed in the table below. You can work through each domain in order, but feel free to jump around.
